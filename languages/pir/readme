Examples for compiling Z-code files to PIR (Parrot Intermediate Representation)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

b.inf		Simple Inform file
b.z5		Compiled b.inf
b_expected.pir	What you should get with "plotz.pl b.z5 pir"
hello_expected.pir	What you should get with plotz.pl ..\hello.z5

PIR translation is, to put it mildly, a work in progress. Almost nothing
works, except for what's in b.inf.
