Support & library files for translating into different languages
-----------------------------------------------------------------

hello.inf		Inform Hello, world program (42 bytes)
hello.z5		Compiled hello.inf (1,536 bytes!)

Various dirs will have hello_expected.*, which is what you should expect
to get when translating hello.z5 to that language. Look at these as a
simple(st) example of how translations work.
