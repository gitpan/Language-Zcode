TODO for v0.9
- More tests
- More POD
- (release Czech 0.9, with save/restore, read)
- Refactor window /cursor / font stuff, cleanup and break apart IO.pm
- Explicit LZ::VirtualMachine object contains Memory object, etc., and
  implements opcodes by calling other classes 
--- optionally, "use LZ::VM qw('ALL')" creates a default object that 
    all opcodes use, more like a true Zmachine
--- LZ::Specs, LZ::Term::* (fix "use Win32" on non-win32 systems hack in IO.pm)
--- LZ::Memory (contains most of what's in PlotzMemory. Translated program
    will just call subs in LZ::Memory with, e.g., a ref to the memory string)
- Add in bugfixes from Games::Rezrov v18, 19
- Stream 3
- read_char
- Build.pl support?
- Termcap? Curses? (ask ME for help)
- Tk
- win32 console retain scroll bar?

maybe for v0.9: z4 (or at least the subset that's already in the code!)
- buffer_mode
- set_text_style, erase_window, get/set_cursor, erase_line
- scan_table
- tokenize, encode_text, set_font (z5, but they're already coded)
- (Czech 0.10 tests z4)

TODO for v1.0
- fix bugs
- save/restore file?
- save_undo, restore_undo? (probably in many Inform z5's)
- bundle all modules into the executable .pl file?
- Czech 0.11

LATER: z5, other translations, & more
- better PIR output
- better XML
- optimize
- better ZSCII (at least latin1)
- print_table, copy_table
- throw, catch
- set_colour
- print_unicode, check_unicode
- Read Disinform files, put varnames etc. into pl file!
- CGI, BASIC, Advent in FORTRAN, binary language of moisture vaporators
